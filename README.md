I am Sheikh Muhammad Ahmad doing MCS from PAF-KIET and working as Network Administrator in Dawn Bread, If AI was an elective course rather than core course, i still select AI because AI programming is based on commonly used algorithm, 
and the real fun is actually creating in models based on the real data. The art of model creation for future predictions and getting the accuracy of upwards of 95% is really challenging task. 
And it is a big achievement for the people who are able to achieve that.AI also offers the solution to many problems for which otherwise it is very difficult or nearly impossible. 
Traditional functional programming doesn’t offer solution to problems like image recognition, image classification, product recommendation, autonomous driving etc.

Why do you study computer science?
I Atif Shahid Qureshi doing MCS from PAF-KIET and working in cargo operations at Gerry Dnata. I am keen to solve problems by using my I.T skills at my workplace, this motivated me to switch in the field of Computer science and to enhance my skills.

Why do you study Artificial Intelligence?
If AI was an elective course rather than core course, I would prefer to select AI because it helps to solve real world complex problems which cannot be solve by traditional programming or very tedious to solve. Studying A.I increase many opportunities to apply in real life scenarios. A.I technologies like chatbots, Google assistant, self-driving cars are really very helpful for the society and improving users’ experience.
