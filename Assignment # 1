Why do you study Artificial intelligence?
if AI was an elective course.

Because Artificial Intelligence has seemingly endless
pontential to improve and simpliy tasks commonly done by humans,
including speech recognition,image processing,business process management,
an even the diagnosis o disease.I already technically inclined 
and have a background in software programming, i may want to consider
a lucrative AI career and know about how to become AI engineer.
