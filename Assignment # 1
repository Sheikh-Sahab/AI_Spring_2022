Due 10th Feb 2022 9:00am

Aim:

Create a GitHub repository so that each group member can display their contribution. Secondly this repository will act as a one point access to all your assignments and project submissions.  
Task:

    Get together in groups of 5 students. 
    All members are to create a GitHub account if do not have one.
    Group Leader (or any 1 member of the group) should create a GitHub repository by the name, "Ai266-spring22"
    All members should be added to the repository as contributors.
    Create a readme.md file with a table that mentions all the group members with their student ids.
    Below the table each member adds a paragraph about themselves and commit it themselves on GitHub. 
    Only the group leader submits the link to the GitHub repository on LMS.

Reminder: All your future assignments and project submissions will be under this repository.
